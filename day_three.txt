Where to store variables if we have too many for the register?

stack: push, pop, storage

RAM == memory

registers, caches, RAM, hard drive

memory: a way to store info and get it back

memory stack:
FF: 00 (255) ff is hexidecimal
...
F4: 00 <-- SP (stack pointer), decrement after pushing onto stack
...
04:
03:
02:
01:
00: loaded commands storage starts here

to pop, return current value at SP and just move pointer up. we'll overwrite the old data next push
